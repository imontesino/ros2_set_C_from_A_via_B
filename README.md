# ROS2 - Set C from A via B

This example implements the answer given in [ROS2 rclpy - Call a Service from inside a Service](https://answers.ros.org/question/342302/ros2-rclpy-call-a-service-from-inside-a-service/) on ROS Answers. Since ROS Answers in deprecated and read-only as of this writing, I am posting the answer here in case it is useful to others.

The answer was given in C++ and in a different context. This example is a translation of the answer to Python within the context of the original question.
